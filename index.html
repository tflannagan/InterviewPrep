        question: "What are some common physical tools for troubleshooting fiber optic issues?",
        answer: "- Power/Light Meter - Measures optical power levels in fiber cables\n- Loopback - Creates a closed circuit to test transmit/receive functions\n- Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) - Locates breaks and measures fiber characteristics\n- Visual Fault Locator - Red laser light to identify breaks and bends\n- 'Good fiber' for reference - Known working fiber for comparison testing",
        category: "troubleshooting"
    },
    {
        question: "Which is typically used for longer distance transmissions?",
        answer: "Single mode fiber - It has a smaller core diameter (9 microns) and uses laser light, allowing signals to travel much longer distances with less attenuation and dispersion compared to multimode fiber. Can transmit over 100+ kilometers.",
        category: "networking"
    },
    {
        question: "What is a type of \"connectionless\" protocol?",
        answer: "UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't establish a connection before sending data and doesn't guarantee delivery, order, or error correction. It's faster but less reliable, used for streaming, gaming, and DNS queries.",
        category: "networking"
    },
    {
        question: "A WAN is different from a LAN because it is...",
        answer: "Geographically displaced - WANs (Wide Area Networks) cover larger geographical areas, connecting multiple LANs across cities, countries, or continents, while LANs (Local Area Networks) are confined to smaller areas like buildings or campuses.",

    },
    {
        question: "What protocol does the 'ping' command utilize?",
        answer: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - Ping sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a destination and waits for Echo Reply packets to test connectivity, measure round-trip time, and diagnose network issues.",

    },
    {
        question: "What is the typical difference between layer 2 and layer 3 network devices?",
        answer: "IP Routing - Layer 3 devices (routers) can route packets between different networks using IP addresses and routing tables, while Layer 2 devices (switches) only forward frames within the same network segment using MAC addresses.",
        category: "networking"
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz wifi?",
        answer: "5GHz has less range than 2.4GHz but offers higher speeds and less congestion. 2.4GHz penetrates walls better, has longer range (150+ feet), but is more crowded and slower. 5GHz provides faster speeds but shorter range (50-100 feet).",
        category: "networking"
    },
    {
        question: "Explain the 7 layers of the OSI Model in great detail",
        answer: "The Seven OSI Layers split network communications into abstraction layers:\n1. Physical - Electrical signals, cables, hubs, repeaters\n2. Data Link - Frame formatting, MAC addresses, switches, error detection\n3. Network - IP routing, logical addressing, routers, packet forwarding\n4. Transport - TCP/UDP, reliable delivery, flow control, segmentation\n5. Session - Connection establishment, management, termination\n6. Presentation - Encryption, compression, data formatting, character encoding\n7. Application - User applications, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS\nMnemonic: 'Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away'",

        category: "hardware"
    },
    {
        question: "A computer boots up and suddenly shuts off after 15 minutes with no errors, you turn it back on, and it does it after 5 minutes, what is most likely the problem?",
        answer: "Heat Issue - The decreasing time between shutdowns indicates thermal protection is activating. Likely causes: failing CPU/GPU fan, clogged heat sinks, dried thermal paste, or inadequate cooling system.",
        category: "troubleshooting"
    },
    {
        question: "Which RAID level provides read and write transfer rates but with no redundancy?",
        answer: "RAID 0 (Striping) - Data is split across multiple drives for improved performance, doubling read/write speeds, but if any drive fails, all data is lost since there's no redundancy or parity information.",
        category: "hardware"
    },
    {
        question: "What is the purpose of thermal paste used on a CPU?",
        answer: "- Reduce heat transfer resistance between CPU and heat sink\n- Prevent movement due to vibration by creating adhesion\n- Fill microscopic imperfections on both the heat sink and CPU surfaces\n- Improve thermal conductivity for efficient heat dissipation",

        category: "networking"
    },
    {
        question: "What are some characteristics between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 cables?",
        answer: "USB 3.0 has 9 pins versus 4-5 with USB 2.0, enabling faster data transfer (5 Gbps vs 480 Mbps). USB 2.0 can carry signals over longer distances due to lower power requirements and simpler signaling. USB 3.0 connectors are often blue-colored.",
        category: "hardware"
    },
    {
        question: "True or False: RAM is typically non-volatile memory",
        answer: "FALSE - RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory, meaning it loses all stored data when power is removed. Non-volatile memory like SSDs, hard drives, and ROM retain data without power.",
        category: "hardware"
    },
    {
        question: "What is the name of the hardware test that is performed by the BIOS on startup?",

        category: "scripting"
    },
    {
        question: "What is the first character of most shell scripts?",
        answer: "# (pound or hash) - Specifically the shebang (#!) followed by the interpreter path (e.g., #!/bin/bash). The # symbol alone is used for comments throughout the script.",
        category: "scripting"
    },
    {
        question: "What does the > (greater than) character do in a script?",
        answer: "Redirects output to a file or another stream - It takes the standard output from a command and writes it to a file, overwriting existing content. Use >> to append instead of overwrite.",
        category: "scripting"
    },
    {
        question: "What is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type?",
        answer: "Array - An ordered collection of elements (usually of the same data type) stored in contiguous memory locations, accessed by index numbers. Examples: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}",
        category: "scripting"
